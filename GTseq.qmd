**Scope and Purpose:**\
The purpose of this procedure is to prepare a next generation sequencing library for SNP
genotyping.\

**Summary of Method: **\
The method consists of two PCR reactions, the first is a locus specific multiplex PCR and the
second is to add the plate and individual indexes which will allow the PCR products to be pooled
together. Prior to pooling, the PCR products are normalized using SequelPrep normalizations
plates. Once the samples from each plate are pooled an Ampure bead cleanup is done, the pooled
plates are quantified using qPCR, and then multiple plates can be pooled to prepare the final
library for sequencing.\

**Health and Safety Warnings:**\
•	Wear latex or nitrile gloves, lab coat, closed-toe shoes and safety glasses.\
•	This procedure uses chemicals that may be harmful.  Please read Appendix A before performing this protocol.\

**Quality Control:**\
• Wear latex or nitrile gloves throughout protocol.\
• Wipe down surface area and pipettes with bleach/EtOH mixture to sterilize surfaces
before and after use.\
• Portions of the protocol should be performed in the Post-PCR labs; do not perform in the
Pre-PCR labs.\

7. SequelPrep Normalization\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Binding step\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Using a multichannel pipette add 10ul binding buffer to each well\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Vortex and briefly centrifuge PCR 2\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Using a multichannel pipette and a full box of tips, transfer 10ul of PCR 2
to SequelPrep Normalization plate.
***Note***: some wells may have less than 10ul due to evaporation, proceed
anyway, just transfer everything.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Seal with Alumaseal, vortex and briefly spin.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Incubate plate at room temperature for 1 hour.
***Note***: more than an hour is okay, but no overnight, 1-2 hrs is fine.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Washing step\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Briefly spin, and remove Aluma seal.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Carefully aspirate all of the liquid from the well taking extra care not to
scrape the side of the wells, it is fine to use the same 8 tips for the entire
plate.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 50ul wash buffer into every well.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Once the wash buffer has been added to each well, use the multichannel
and the same 8 tips to flush the wells by pipetting up and down twice and
then completely aspirating the buffer from the wells and discarding. Again
taking caution to not scrape the sides of the wells.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Once the wash buffer has been aspirated from each well, invert and tap
(aggressively) the plate onto paper towels in order to remove any residual
wash buffer from the wells.
***Note***: A small amount of wash buffer (1-3ul) remaining is typical and will
not affect downstream applications.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Elution step\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Using multichannel pipette, add 20ul of SequelPrep Normalization Elution
buffer to each well.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Seal with Alumaseal, vortex and briefly spin\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes\
8. Pool plate
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Using a multichannel pipette, take 10ul from each well of the SequelPrep
normalized plate and combine into strip tube and then into a 1.7ml tube, or a boat
to a 1.7ml tube.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. SequelPrep Plate can be discarded at this point, or if preferred saved until library
is complete.\
9. Bead Size selection\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Removing long sequences (> 300bp)\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Pull 50ul from each plate pool and place into a strip tube\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Vortex Ampure XP beads well\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Add 25ul of beads to each strip tube well (1:0.5 ratio)\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Mix well, and incubate for 5 min.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Transfer strip tubes to magnetic plate and let sit for 3 min.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. Carefully remove the supernatant from the beads and transfer to a new set
of strip tubes, discard the beads.
***Note***: the unwanted long sequences, >300bp are attached to the beads\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Removing the short sequences (<100bp)\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Vortex the Ampure XP beads well\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Add 35ul of beads to each strip tube with the supernatant\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Mix well, and incubate for 5 min.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Transfer strip tubes to magnetic plate and let sit for 3 min.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.
***Note***: the undesirable short sequences <100bp are in the supernatant.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Wash step\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Prepare fresh 70% ethanol, 1ml is enough for 2.5 tubes.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. While still on the magnetic plate, gently add 200ul of fresh 70% ethanol to
the strip tubes containing the beads, incubate at room temp for 30 sec.,
remove ethanol from strip tube and discard.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Repeat\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Remove strip tube from magnetic plate and allow any residual ethanol to
evaporate by letting stand for 10 min (no more than 15 min) uncovered.
***Note***: you should observe the beads starting to dry and crack, this is good\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Elute\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Add 15ul 1x TE to strip tube containing beads and mix well to elute.
Ensure that TE washed beads from side of the tube, beads should be
dissolved into TE.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Place on the magnetic plate for 2 minutes\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Collect the cleared supernatant and transfer to new strip tube\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Add 1.5ul EBT (EB containing 1% Tween-20)\
10. Plate quantification\
We have 3 options for quantifying pooled plates:\
1) qPCR using the KAPA kit (PR-037.00 Quantify using KAPA standards with
SYBR mix). Note: It is recommended to do 2-3 replicates of 3 dilutions such as
1:5000, 1:10000, and 1:50000\
2)Qubit (PR-038.00 Procedure to quantify using the Qubit)\
3) Bioanalyzer (NG-004.00 Procedure to quantify using the Bioanalyzer).\
It is recommended to quantify with multiple methods and review results with PI to
plan for pooling plates.\
11. Normalize plate pools to between 2.5nM -5nM (the final concentration may vary based
on plate quantification outcome and PI recommendations)\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Starting with 10ul of BSS DNA (bead size selected DNA)\
    EXAMPLE:
      10ul BSS DNA x 15.73nM (qPCR conc.) / 5nM (agreed upon conc) =
31.46ul -10ul BSS DNA = 21.46 ul TE/Tween
      So you would take 10ul of BSS DNA + 21.46ul TE/Tween to dilute it to 5nM\
***Note***: see Appendix C for converting from ng/ul to nM\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Combine 5ul of each normalized pooled plate to make your final library.
***Note***: it is good practice to also quantify the pooled library before sending to the
sequencing facility or loading onto the MiSeq. Refer to step 10 above for
quantification methods.\
12. If running library on MiSeq in house, refer to NG-004.00 Procedure to run the MiSeq.\
