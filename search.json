    "text": "The Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Research Tissue Collection is one of the largest marine mammal and marine turtle sample collections in the world, serving a pivotal role in accomplishing the mandates and mission of the Agency. The collection comprises over 290,000 tissue and DNA samples from 118 species collected globally over the past 30 years (with some samples dating back more than 100 years).\nWe have a vast network of SQL databases that enable us to access and curate the data associated with the collection. Below is a list of the databases most relevent to the MMTD genetics programs.\nThere are several ID numbers assigned to samples as they become a part of our Archive. Once a sample is archived it will be associated with a Lab_ID, an Animal_ID/Turtle_ID, and one or more Tissue_IDs (depending on how many tissue samples were collected for that individual. Once the DNA has been extracted a sample will also be associated with a DNA_ID, and can have multiple DNA_ID numbers if it is extracted multiple times.\n\nTissue Archive The tissue archive database includes both mammals and turtles and has an animal collection event as the unique identifier. Lab_ID or Animal_ID are the primary ID numbers used in this database. There can be replicate animals in this database, different Lab_Id, but same Animal_ID. It is the place to look for basic collection information including animal ID, field ID, species, sex, collection type, collection date, collection location, latitude and longitude, city, state, county, country, island, ocean basin, associated cruise, use restrictions, contact, comments.\nTurtle Archive The turtle archive is very similar to the tissue archive, but includes only turtles and has a few different fields, such as turtle specific measurements, collection method, animal activity, gear type, stage class, sample type.\nTissue Vial Storage Database The primary ID number used in this database is the Tissue_ID number. Some of the information that you will find in this database includes information about the tissue type, quantity, perservative and location of the tissue sample.\nExtraction Database When samples are extracted they are entered into this database as a part of a batch, so there is a Extraction batch table as well as an extraction sample table. Batch information includes batch #, project supervisor, extraction contact, extraction type, date, number of samples extracted, number of negative controls, contamination iformation, and comments. Sample information includes Batch #, Lab_ID, Tissue_ID, DNA_ID, comments.\nDNA Storage Database DNA_ID number is the primary identifier used in this database, this is where DNA location, concentration, quantity, use restrictions, and associated comments can be found.\nRun Index Database When DNA is processed in the genetics labs, meaning an additional genetics files are created, those files are archived in the Run Index. The files found in the run index were generally run on an Applied Biosystems Genetic Analyzer and are either a Sanger sequencing file(.ab1) which is generated when sequencing mitochondrial DNA, or a genescan file(.fsa) generated when running microsatellites on nuclear DNA. Information that you can find in this database would include Lab_ID, run date, plate information, file type, primer, assay, plate well, file name.\nNGS Run Library and NGS Fastq Databases This is very similar to the Run Index database but for .fastq files that were generated while sequencing an NGS(next generation sequencing library).There are 2 main databases the NGS Run Library database, and NGS Fastq database. The Run Library database contains information such as a run_ID, run date, # of samples, species, library prep method, sequencing instrument used, sequencing location, read length, read type. The NGS fastq database includes information about the individual samples that were included in each run, so Lab_ID, DNA_ID, run_ID, Indexes used, original file name and archived file name. I\nPrimer and Assay Databases When DNA is processed in the genetics labs, meaning an additional genetics files are created (.fasta, .fastq, .ab1, .fsa), those files are archived in the Run Index or NGS Run Library databases. The primers or assays used when generating that data can be found in these databases.\nSequence Database This database is where mitochondrial DNA haplotypes that are assigned after running sanger sequencing are captured. You will find Lab_ID, DNA_ID, run date, aligned date, haplotype name, user that called the haplotype, comments.\nMicrosatellite genotype database This is where the genotypes that are called from genescans are captured. The types of data you will find here include Lab_ID, DNA_ID, run name, run date, marker(assay), allele calls, raw data peak heights, and raw data lengths.\nSNP genotype database This is similar to the microsatellite database but these calls are typically made after a qPCR assay."

    "text": "Leatherback Population Vital Rates: Age to Maturity (GTseq)\nDetermination of sea turtle population vital rates such as age to maturity, survival, sex ratios, and population size has been an ongoing SAIP priority for NMFS, and particularly for leatherbacks, where lack of basic demographic information continues to limit capacity to conduct more rigorous population and risk assessments. Since 2009, mass sampling of hatchlings has been carried out each nesting season at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge(SPNWR), St.¬†Croix, US Virgin Islands as part of the first (‚Äúmark‚Äù) phase of an innovative long term CMR study to determine the age at first reproduction for leatherbacks. Over 62,000 hatchlings have been sampled to date. Since natal homing is known to occur in the SPNWR nesting population, in 2016 we initiated the second (‚Äúrecapture‚Äù) phase of the CMR experiment to determine whether any of the ‚Äútagged‚Äù hatchlings from the first large cohort sampled in 2009 have matured and nested. The Marine Turtle Genetics Group is completing genotyping &gt;4,000 St.¬†Croix leatherback hatchlings from the 2009 and 2010 nesting seasons and will begin processing 2011 hatchling samples to expand the baseline. We are using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in order to genotype the hatchlings and compare them to genotypes of adult first time nesters sampled in recent years to see if any have matured and returned to their natal beach to nest. In FY21 we expanded our SNP panel with additional SNPs and also incorporated microsatellites into our GT-Seq assays, and these will be further applied in FY22."

    "text": "Leatherback Population Vital Rates: Breeding Sex Ratios, STX (GTseq)\nThe previously increasing trend in leatherback nesting populations throughout the NW Atlantic has reversed in recent years, causing alarm and raising questions as to the status of this RMU or putative DPS. This is the case in St.¬†Croix, with record low numbers of nesters in the last five consecutive years (Stewart et al.¬†in prep). The 1:1 breeding sex ratios estimates for St.¬†Croix were based on analysis for 2009-2011 (Stewart & Dutton 2014), and given the dramatic decline in the last few years, we started to re-evaluate breeding sex ratios in 2019 after a 10-year hiatus to determine if there has been a change in the proportion of males. This is a unique opportunity to extend a representative evaluation of current breeding sex ratios beyond a decade from the baseline we established in 2009, at what appears to be a period of transition in population trajectory. Analysis of hatchling samples from 2017, 2018, 2019 is being done with FY20-21 funding. This work is being extended with FY22-23 awarded funding to analyze samples from 2020, 2021 and 2022 to determine breeding sex ratios and provide a 13 year time series for an index northern Caribbean population (St.¬†Croix)."

We have been awarded FY22-23 funding (S&T STIFA/SAIP). We will build on the current baseline dataset from the most extensively sampled nesting site in Hawai‚Äôi to determine demographic structure of this index population and expand sampling to incorporate individual nesting samples from other sites around the Hawaiian Islands (e.g.¬†Maui, Moloka‚Äòi), to map connectivity between nesting sites. Next, all other samples (in water, strandings, males, juveniles, post-hatchlings) will be incorporated to determine demographic connectivity and origin of adults and juveniles. We will add samples already obtained from rare nesters on other Pacific Islands to determine connectivity (if any) of individuals in Hawai‚Äòi with breeding populations elsewhere in the Pacific. Finally, we will genotype samples we have collected from foraging grounds in Guam, Palau, Northern Mariana Islands to determine whether they are from Hawai‚Äôi. Previous mtDNA analysis of these samples detected Hawaii nesting haplotypes that are common at the Guam and Mariana foraging grounds ~6,000 km away, but mtDNA tools are insufficient to confirm this connectivity. Our pairwise relatedness analysis between all the sampled nesters and foraging turtles will be able to determine whether Hawai‚Äôi juveniles disperse to these distant foraging grounds."

We are also moving towards being able to also individually assign green turtles with microsatellites. Routine mtDNA sequencing allows us to perform Mixed Stock Analysis (MSA) for all species. This project is in collaboration with PIFSC and PIRO to address management needs driven by Biological Opinions and Species Recovery Planning, and is an on-going effort.\n‚Ä¢ Atlantic Leatherback and Loggerhead Longline Fisheries By-catch from the SEFSC This work is a component of our (MTGP) core mission as NOAA‚Äôs Center for sea turtle genetics, which is to determine the stock origin of turtles caught in longline fisheries monitored by SEFSC/SERO. This project is to determine the stock origin of leatherback and loggerhead turtles caught in Atlantic longline fisheries by analyzing microsatellite profiles (leatherbacks) and mtDNA of all sampled turtles. We recently published the results from the analysis of ~400 leatherbacks (Stewart, K.R., LaCasella, E.L., Roden, S.E. et al.¬†2016. Ecosphere) in collaboration with SEFSC. Samples are sent semi-regularly, we will continue to process additional batches to add to this on-going project.\n‚Ä¢ West Coast Turtle Strandings This project is to determine the stock origin of stranded turtles along the US west coast by analyzing mtDNA sequences and nDNA genotypes of sampled stranded turtles. Although there is no nesting along the US west coast, we do have greens, loggerheads, leatherbacks and olive ridley turtles that forage in the waters along California, Oregon and Washington. This project is an on-going effort, especially with increasing numbers of stranded individuals in the recent past. This work is in collaboration with WCRO and the US West Coast Stranding Network. Information serves to gain insight into dispersal, life history and connectivity among Pacific sea turtle populations.\n\n‚Ä¢ Leatherback Turtle Stock Assignment A. Along with our established baseline dataset of globally distributed leatherback turtle populations that genetically characterizes and distinguishes stocks by using a suite of 16 microsatellite markers, we can generate a genotype for an individual and determine its stock origin through assignment analysis. This is ongoing as MTGP receives samples from different regions, and information is applied to several projects as needed (e.g.¬†Fisheries bycatch, strandings, FG/In-water assessment). The overall goal is to compile a geo-spatial stock-specific distribution map for each ocean basin to better understand the boundaries of leatherback nesting populations in the marine environment (DPS, MU and DIP)."

    "text": "Archiving:\nAccessioning priorities as of 8 February 2023 in order:/ 1. Strandings, one offs, mostly complete except labeling: Seattle Aquarium, SeaWorld (including olive blood), Pacific Marine Mammal Center, California Academy of Sciences, SWFSC. Should all be done this week. SeaWorld may take slightly longer. I‚Äôm waiting on answers from Lexi to finish that one off. PMMC, CAS, and SWFSC were all accessioned this week (MTGP email coming at end of week). Hawaii long line samples from a 2014 shipment were also completed this week.\n2. St.¬†Croix. Should be complete this week unless there are questions on the data.\n3. DNA Accessions. Database error has been fixed, and I can accession DNA again.\n4. Fiji. Inventory underway.\n5. Remaining San Diego Bay/Seal Beach samples.\n6. Continue labeling NPAIS whenever possible.\n\nCurrent projects as of 22 March 2022: 1. St.¬†Croix 2021 samples and data received. Need inventory, accessioning, and labeling. [15 June: Done.]\n2. 2021 Hawaiian hawksbill hatchling samples and data received. ¬Ω inventoried. Need to finish inventory, accession, and label. Should be doable in short time frame. [26 April Update: Accessioned. Needs labeling.]\n3. Galapagos samples. Awaiting word that they have cleared USFWS before proceeding. [15 June Update: I would like to relabel these, because I got more complete Field ID data, but they are labeled, etc.]\n4. Mexico samples. Either very recently or not yet received (Erin coordinating.). Will await word that they‚Äôve cleared USFWS before proceeding. [15 June Update: Inventoried. Most of the data is physically on the vials rather than in the provided datasheet. Questions about import and provenience before I can move forward.]\n5. NPS 2021 samples. Accessioned. I‚Äôm labeling these as time permits around new accessions. [26 April Update: Done.]\n6. St.¬†Croix 2020. Waiting on data from Kelly Stewart to finish last few females and spacers (questions on data) and to work on the hatchlings (data not yet received). [15 June Update: Data in prep for accession of hatchlings. Can probably finish in full within a week, but have a couple of mammal priority batches to finish first.]\n7. 2020 Hawaiian hatchlings. Done. Working with Amy to pick a date to get them into bins in the freezer (multiple person job given height of storage/weight of bins). Need to return cooler to Alex. [15 June Update: Cooler back with Alex in HI.]\n8. NPS 2020 samples. Accessioned. Labeling ongoing. [15 June Update: Done.]\n9. I‚Äôm expecting additional turtle strandings in April or so for accession to go with Heather Harris‚Äô biotoxin study sample send off. I anticipate these being quick turnaround. [15 June Update: Heather Harris samples sent off 13 June 2022.]\n10. Have asked Barbara Schroeder for the EVER numbers for the most recent Everglades loan samples, so that I can add them to the database and find the samples in our collection when requested for the annual spotcheck.\n11. Extraction batches, check in/check out DNA/tissue, loan documentation, etc. as needed.\nNote: Turtle labeling is one of the big hurdles with limited lab time, because labeling is the most time-consuming part of the accessioning process (assuming the data is pretty clean), and turtles tend to come in large numbers. I‚Äôve been prioritizing inventory through accession, and labeling large batches when I have time around new specimens in mammals or turtles. This will take some time to catch up on the label backlog when we have more lab access.\nNote 2: With Kelly retiring, I‚Äôm hoping to focus a lot of time on straightening out the years old Mammals backlog (Turtles has one too, but nobody‚Äôs retiring that I know of!) before she goes."
