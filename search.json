    "text": "The Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Research Tissue Collection is one of the largest marine mammal and marine turtle sample collections in the world, serving a pivotal role in accomplishing the mandates and mission of the Agency. The collection comprises over 290,000 tissue and DNA samples from 118 species collected globally over the past 30 years (with some samples dating back more than 100 years).\nWe have a vast network of SQL databases that enable us to access and curate the data associated with the collection. Below is a list of the databases most relevent to the MMTD genetics programs.\nThere are several ID numbers assigned to samples as they become a part of our Archive. Once a sample is archived it will be associated with a Lab_ID, an Animal_ID/Turtle_ID, and one or more Tissue_IDs (depending on how many tissue samples were collected for that individual. Once the DNA has been extracted a sample will also be associated with a DNA_ID, and can have multiple DNA_ID numbers if it is extracted multiple times.\n\nTissue Archive The tissue archive database includes both mammals and turtles and has an animal collection event as the unique identifier. Lab_ID or Animal_ID are the primary ID numbers used in this database. There can be replicate animals in this database, different Lab_Id, but same Animal_ID. It is the place to look for basic collection information including animal ID, field ID, species, sex, collection type, collection date, collection location, latitude and longitude, city, state, county, country, island, ocean basin, associated cruise, use restrictions, contact, comments.\nTurtle Archive The turtle archive is very similar to the tissue archive, but includes only turtles and has a few different fields, such as turtle specific measurements, collection method, animal activity, gear type, stage class, sample type.\nTissue Vial Storage Database The primary ID number used in this database is the Tissue_ID number. Some of the information that you will find in this database includes information about the tissue type, quantity, perservative and location of the tissue sample.\nExtraction Database When samples are extracted they are entered into this database as a part of a batch, so there is a Extraction batch table as well as an extraction sample table. Batch information includes batch #, project supervisor, extraction contact, extraction type, date, number of samples extracted, number of negative controls, contamination iformation, and comments. Sample information includes Batch #, Lab_ID, Tissue_ID, DNA_ID, comments.\nDNA Storage Database DNA_ID number is the primary identifier used in this database, this is where DNA location, concentration, quantity, use restrictions, and associated comments can be found.\nRun Index Database When DNA is processed in the genetics labs, meaning an additional genetics files are created, those files are archived in the Run Index. The files found in the run index were generally run on an Applied Biosystems Genetic Analyzer and are either a Sanger sequencing file(.ab1) which is generated when sequencing mitochondrial DNA, or a genescan file(.fsa) generated when running microsatellites on nuclear DNA. Information that you can find in this database would include Lab_ID, run date, plate information, file type, primer, assay, plate well, file name.\nNGS Run Library and NGS Fastq Databases This is very similar to the Run Index database but for .fastq files that were generated while sequencing an NGS(next generation sequencing library).There are 2 main databases the NGS Run Library database, and NGS Fastq database. The Run Library database contains information such as a run_ID, run date, # of samples, species, library prep method, sequencing instrument used, sequencing location, read length, read type. The NGS fastq database includes information about the individual samples that were included in each run, so Lab_ID, DNA_ID, run_ID, Indexes used, original file name and archived file name. I\nPrimer and Assay Databases When DNA is processed in the genetics labs, meaning an additional genetics files are created (.fasta, .fastq, .ab1, .fsa), those files are archived in the Run Index or NGS Run Library databases. The primers or assays used when generating that data can be found in these databases.\nSequence Database This database is where mitochondrial DNA haplotypes that are assigned after running sanger sequencing are captured. You will find Lab_ID, DNA_ID, run date, aligned date, haplotype name, user that called the haplotype, comments.\nMicrosatellite genotype database This is where the genotypes that are called from genescans are captured. The types of data you will find here include Lab_ID, DNA_ID, run name, run date, marker(assay), allele calls, raw data peak heights, and raw data lengths.\nSNP genotype database This is similar to the microsatellite database but these calls are typically made after a qPCR assay."

    "text": "Leatherback Population Vital Rates: Age to Maturity (GTseq)\nDetermination of sea turtle population vital rates such as age to maturity, survival, sex ratios, and population size has been an ongoing SAIP priority for NMFS, and particularly for leatherbacks, where lack of basic demographic information continues to limit capacity to conduct more rigorous population and risk assessments. Since 2009, mass sampling of hatchlings has been carried out each nesting season at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge(SPNWR), St.¬†Croix, US Virgin Islands as part of the first (‚Äúmark‚Äù) phase of an innovative long term CMR study to determine the age at first reproduction for leatherbacks. Over 62,000 hatchlings have been sampled to date. Since natal homing is known to occur in the SPNWR nesting population, in 2016 we initiated the second (‚Äúrecapture‚Äù) phase of the CMR experiment to determine whether any of the ‚Äútagged‚Äù hatchlings from the first large cohort sampled in 2009 have matured and nested. The Marine Turtle Genetics Group is completing genotyping &gt;4,000 St.¬†Croix leatherback hatchlings from the 2009 and 2010 nesting seasons and will begin processing 2011 hatchling samples to expand the baseline. We are using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in order to genotype the hatchlings and compare them to genotypes of adult first time nesters sampled in recent years to see if any have matured and returned to their natal beach to nest. In FY21 we expanded our SNP panel with additional SNPs and also incorporated microsatellites into our GT-Seq assays, and these will be further applied in FY22."

    "text": "Leatherback Population Vital Rates: Breeding Sex Ratios, STX (GTseq)\nThe previously increasing trend in leatherback nesting populations throughout the NW Atlantic has reversed in recent years, causing alarm and raising questions as to the status of this RMU or putative DPS. This is the case in St.¬†Croix, with record low numbers of nesters in the last five consecutive years (Stewart et al.¬†in prep). The 1:1 breeding sex ratios estimates for St.¬†Croix were based on analysis for 2009-2011 (Stewart & Dutton 2014), and given the dramatic decline in the last few years, we started to re-evaluate breeding sex ratios in 2019 after a 10-year hiatus to determine if there has been a change in the proportion of males. This is a unique opportunity to extend a representative evaluation of current breeding sex ratios beyond a decade from the baseline we established in 2009, at what appears to be a period of transition in population trajectory. Analysis of hatchling samples from 2017, 2018, 2019 is being done with FY20-21 funding. This work is being extended with FY22-23 awarded funding to analyze samples from 2020, 2021 and 2022 to determine breeding sex ratios and provide a 13 year time series for an index northern Caribbean population (St.¬†Croix)."

We have been awarded FY22-23 funding (S&T STIFA/SAIP). We will build on the current baseline dataset from the most extensively sampled nesting site in Hawai‚Äôi to determine demographic structure of this index population and expand sampling to incorporate individual nesting samples from other sites around the Hawaiian Islands (e.g.¬†Maui, Moloka‚Äòi), to map connectivity between nesting sites. Next, all other samples (in water, strandings, males, juveniles, post-hatchlings) will be incorporated to determine demographic connectivity and origin of adults and juveniles. We will add samples already obtained from rare nesters on other Pacific Islands to determine connectivity (if any) of individuals in Hawai‚Äòi with breeding populations elsewhere in the Pacific. Finally, we will genotype samples we have collected from foraging grounds in Guam, Palau, Northern Mariana Islands to determine whether they are from Hawai‚Äôi. Previous mtDNA analysis of these samples detected Hawaii nesting haplotypes that are common at the Guam and Mariana foraging grounds ~6,000 km away, but mtDNA tools are insufficient to confirm this connectivity. Our pairwise relatedness analysis between all the sampled nesters and foraging turtles will be able to determine whether Hawai‚Äôi juveniles disperse to these distant foraging grounds."

We are also moving towards being able to also individually assign green turtles with microsatellites. Routine mtDNA sequencing allows us to perform Mixed Stock Analysis (MSA) for all species. This project is in collaboration with PIFSC and PIRO to address management needs driven by Biological Opinions and Species Recovery Planning, and is an on-going effort.\n‚Ä¢ Atlantic Leatherback and Loggerhead Longline Fisheries By-catch from the SEFSC This work is a component of our (MTGP) core mission as NOAA‚Äôs Center for sea turtle genetics, which is to determine the stock origin of turtles caught in longline fisheries monitored by SEFSC/SERO. This project is to determine the stock origin of leatherback and loggerhead turtles caught in Atlantic longline fisheries by analyzing microsatellite profiles (leatherbacks) and mtDNA of all sampled turtles. We recently published the results from the analysis of ~400 leatherbacks (Stewart, K.R., LaCasella, E.L., Roden, S.E. et al.¬†2016. Ecosphere) in collaboration with SEFSC. Samples are sent semi-regularly, we will continue to process additional batches to add to this on-going project.\n‚Ä¢ West Coast Turtle Strandings This project is to determine the stock origin of stranded turtles along the US west coast by analyzing mtDNA sequences and nDNA genotypes of sampled stranded turtles. Although there is no nesting along the US west coast, we do have greens, loggerheads, leatherbacks and olive ridley turtles that forage in the waters along California, Oregon and Washington. This project is an on-going effort, especially with increasing numbers of stranded individuals in the recent past. This work is in collaboration with WCRO and the US West Coast Stranding Network. Information serves to gain insight into dispersal, life history and connectivity among Pacific sea turtle populations.\n\n‚Ä¢ Leatherback Turtle Stock Assignment A. Along with our established baseline dataset of globally distributed leatherback turtle populations that genetically characterizes and distinguishes stocks by using a suite of 16 microsatellite markers, we can generate a genotype for an individual and determine its stock origin through assignment analysis. This is ongoing as MTGP receives samples from different regions, and information is applied to several projects as needed (e.g.¬†Fisheries bycatch, strandings, FG/In-water assessment). The overall goal is to compile a geo-spatial stock-specific distribution map for each ocean basin to better understand the boundaries of leatherback nesting populations in the marine environment (DPS, MU and DIP)."

    "text": "Archiving:\nAccessioning priorities as of 8 February 2023 in order:/ 1. Strandings, one offs, mostly complete except labeling: Seattle Aquarium, SeaWorld (including olive blood), Pacific Marine Mammal Center, California Academy of Sciences, SWFSC. Should all be done this week. SeaWorld may take slightly longer. I‚Äôm waiting on answers from Lexi to finish that one off. PMMC, CAS, and SWFSC were all accessioned this week (MTGP email coming at end of week). Hawaii long line samples from a 2014 shipment were also completed this week.\n2. St.¬†Croix. Should be complete this week unless there are questions on the data.\n3. DNA Accessions. Database error has been fixed, and I can accession DNA again.\n4. Fiji. Inventory underway.\n5. Remaining San Diego Bay/Seal Beach samples.\n6. Continue labeling NPAIS whenever possible.\n\nCurrent projects as of 22 March 2022: 1. St.¬†Croix 2021 samples and data received. Need inventory, accessioning, and labeling. [15 June: Done.]\n2. 2021 Hawaiian hawksbill hatchling samples and data received. ¬Ω inventoried. Need to finish inventory, accession, and label. Should be doable in short time frame. [26 April Update: Accessioned. Needs labeling.]\n3. Galapagos samples. Awaiting word that they have cleared USFWS before proceeding. [15 June Update: I would like to relabel these, because I got more complete Field ID data, but they are labeled, etc.]\n4. Mexico samples. Either very recently or not yet received (Erin coordinating.). Will await word that they‚Äôve cleared USFWS before proceeding. [15 June Update: Inventoried. Most of the data is physically on the vials rather than in the provided datasheet. Questions about import and provenience before I can move forward.]\n5. NPS 2021 samples. Accessioned. I‚Äôm labeling these as time permits around new accessions. [26 April Update: Done.]\n6. St.¬†Croix 2020. Waiting on data from Kelly Stewart to finish last few females and spacers (questions on data) and to work on the hatchlings (data not yet received). [15 June Update: Data in prep for accession of hatchlings. Can probably finish in full within a week, but have a couple of mammal priority batches to finish first.]\n7. 2020 Hawaiian hatchlings. Done. Working with Amy to pick a date to get them into bins in the freezer (multiple person job given height of storage/weight of bins). Need to return cooler to Alex. [15 June Update: Cooler back with Alex in HI.]\n8. NPS 2020 samples. Accessioned. Labeling ongoing. [15 June Update: Done.]\n9. I‚Äôm expecting additional turtle strandings in April or so for accession to go with Heather Harris‚Äô biotoxin study sample send off. I anticipate these being quick turnaround. [15 June Update: Heather Harris samples sent off 13 June 2022.]\n10. Have asked Barbara Schroeder for the EVER numbers for the most recent Everglades loan samples, so that I can add them to the database and find the samples in our collection when requested for the annual spotcheck.\n11. Extraction batches, check in/check out DNA/tissue, loan documentation, etc. as needed.\nNote: Turtle labeling is one of the big hurdles with limited lab time, because labeling is the most time-consuming part of the accessioning process (assuming the data is pretty clean), and turtles tend to come in large numbers. I‚Äôve been prioritizing inventory through accession, and labeling large batches when I have time around new specimens in mammals or turtles. This will take some time to catch up on the label backlog when we have more lab access.\nNote 2: With Kelly retiring, I‚Äôm hoping to focus a lot of time on straightening out the years old Mammals backlog (Turtles has one too, but nobody‚Äôs retiring that I know of!) before she goes."

These range in severity from a minor cut with a clean blade to severing tendons with a dirty blade. Since we are often working with dead mammal tissue, infection from a dirty blade is almost a guarantee. Usually you are started on antibiotics, and sometimes stitches or even surgery are required. We can avoid these accidents if we really take our use of blades seriously and follow a few good practices.\nWhen to use a blade:\n‚Ä¢ Razor blades and scalpels are for working with small pieces of tissue. If your sample is large use an appropriate knife.\n‚Ä¢ Only use a blade on tissue that requires very little force applied (the amount you might apply to cut a piece of toast). If you have to press hard you‚Äôve got the wrong tool and are endangering yourself.\nGood practices with a blade:\n‚Ä¢ Cut away from yourself. I know you know, but we all cheat on this one and if we didn‚Äôt there would be a lot less accidents ‚Ä¶and in the lab environment the accidents can be severe.\n‚Ä¢ Use something other than your hand/fingers to hold the sample in place. Since it is a small sample you should be able to use things like forceps, a toothpick, a needle, etc. ‚Ä¢ Let your piece thaw enough to allow you to cut it easily (again like toast).\n‚Ä¢ Look at the blade before you cut. There have been times when people have pushed down on the wrong edge of a razor blade, or grabbed the wrong end of the scalpel.\n‚Ä¢ Never apply force at an angle. Cut straight down etc. Blades can snap when oblique force is applied and the pieces go airborne.\n‚Ä¢ Wear safety glasses.\n‚Ä¢ Report all cuts to the Lab Manager and Safety Officer\nAppendix B: Digestion Master Mix\nImportant to make fresh each time Equipment and Supplies:\n‚Ä¢ Lifton‚Äôs Buffer\n‚Ä¢ DTT (1M)\n‚Ä¢ Proteinase K (4.2 mg/ml)\n‚Ä¢ Pipettes (10ŒºL, 100ŒºL, 1000ŒºL)\n‚Ä¢ Pipette tips (20ŒºL, 100ŒºL, 1000ŒºL)\n‚Ä¢ Multi-channel pipette (20ŒºL, 1000ŒºL)\n‚Ä¢ Multi-channel pipette tips (20ŒºL, 1000ŒºL)\n‚Ä¢ Serological Pipette Controller\n‚Ä¢ Serological Pipette Tip (10ml)\n‚Ä¢ 1.7 ml tube (or 15ml falcon tube) for mixing\n‚Ä¢ Reagent reservoir\nTo make 1X you will need to add (in a 1.7ml tube):\n20 ŒºL Lifton‚Äôs buffer\n17 ŒºL Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)\n3.0 ŒºL DTT (1 M)\nTo make enough for a full plate (110X) you will need to add (in a 15ml conical tube):\n2.2 ml Lifton‚Äôs buffer\n1.87 ml Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)\n330 ŒºL DTT (1M)"

Prior to pooling, the PCR products are normalized using SequelPrep normalizations plates. Once the samples from each plate are pooled an Ampure bead cleanup is done, the pooled plates are quantified using qPCR, and then multiple plates can be pooled to prepare the final library for sequencing.\nHealth and Safety Warnings:\n‚Ä¢ Wear latex or nitrile gloves, lab coat, closed-toe shoes and safety glasses.\n‚Ä¢ This procedure uses chemicals that may be harmful. Please read Appendix A before performing this protocol.\nQuality Control:\n‚Ä¢ Wear latex or nitrile gloves throughout protocol.\n‚Ä¢ Wipe down surface area and pipettes with bleach/EtOH mixture to sterilize surfaces before and after use.\n‚Ä¢ Portions of the protocol should be performed in the Post-PCR labs; do not perform in the Pre-PCR labs.\nEquipment and Supplies:\n1. 96-well semi-skirted plate\n2.

Vortex and briefly centrifuge PCR 2\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Using a multichannel pipette and a full box of tips, transfer 10ul of PCR 2 to SequelPrep Normalization plate. Note: some wells may have less than 10ul due to evaporation, proceed anyway, just transfer everything.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iv. Seal with Alumaseal, vortex and briefly spin.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†v. Incubate plate at room temperature for 1 hour. Note: more than an hour is okay, but no overnight, 1-2 hrs is fine.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†b. Washing step\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†i. Briefly spin, and remove Aluma seal.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ii. Carefully aspirate all of the liquid from the well taking extra care not to scrape the side of the wells, it is fine to use the same 8 tips for the entire plate.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 50ul wash buffer into every well.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iv. Once the wash buffer has been added to each well, use the multichannel and the same 8 tips to flush the wells by pipetting up and down twice and then completely aspirating the buffer from the wells and discarding. Again taking caution to not scrape the sides of the wells.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†v. Once the wash buffer has been aspirated from each well, invert and tap (aggressively) the plate onto paper towels in order to remove any residual wash buffer from the wells. Note: A small amount of wash buffer (1-3ul) remaining is typical and will not affect downstream applications.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†c.¬†Elution step\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†i. Using multichannel pipette, add 20ul of SequelPrep Normalization Elution buffer to each well.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ii. Seal with Alumaseal, vortex and briefly spin\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes\n8. Pool plate ¬†¬†¬†¬†a. Using a multichannel pipette, take 10ul from each well of the SequelPrep normalized plate and combine into strip tube and then into a 1.7ml tube, or a boat to a 1.7ml tube.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†b. SequelPrep Plate can be discarded at this point, or if preferred saved until library is complete.\n9. Bead Size selection\n¬†¬†¬†¬†a. Removing long sequences (&gt; 300bp)\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†i. Pull 50ul from each plate pool and place into a strip tube\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ii. Vortex Ampure XP beads well\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Add 25ul of beads to each strip tube well (1:0.5 ratio)\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iv. Mix well, and incubate for 5 min.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†v. Transfer strip tubes to magnetic plate and let sit for 3 min.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†vi. Carefully remove the supernatant from the beads and transfer to a new set of strip tubes, discard the beads. Note: the unwanted long sequences, &gt;300bp are attached to the beads\n¬†¬†¬†¬†b. Removing the short sequences (&lt;100bp)\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†i. Vortex the Ampure XP beads well\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ii. Add 35ul of beads to each strip tube with the supernatant\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Mix well, and incubate for 5 min.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iv. Transfer strip tubes to magnetic plate and let sit for 3 min.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†v. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Note: the undesirable short sequences &lt;100bp are in the supernatant.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†c.¬†Wash step\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†i. Prepare fresh 70% ethanol, 1ml is enough for 2.5 tubes.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ii. While still on the magnetic plate, gently add 200ul of fresh 70% ethanol to the strip tubes containing the beads, incubate at room temp for 30 sec., remove ethanol from strip tube and discard.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Repeat\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iv. Remove strip tube from magnetic plate and allow any residual ethanol to evaporate by letting stand for 10 min (no more than 15 min) uncovered. Note: you should observe the beads starting to dry and crack, this is good\n¬†¬†¬†¬†d.¬†Elute\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†i. Add 15ul 1x TE to strip tube containing beads and mix well to elute. Ensure that TE washed beads from side of the tube, beads should be dissolved into TE.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ii. Place on the magnetic plate for 2 minutes\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iii. Collect the cleared supernatant and transfer to new strip tube\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†iv. Add 1.5ul EBT (EB containing 1% Tween-20)\n10. Plate quantification\nWe have 3 options for quantifying pooled plates:\n1) qPCR using the KAPA kit (PR-037.00 Quantify using KAPA standards with SYBR mix). Note: It is recommended to do 2-3 replicates of 3 dilutions such as 1:5000, 1:10000, and 1:50000\n2)Qubit (PR-038.00 Procedure to quantify using the Qubit)\n3) Bioanalyzer (NG-004.00 Procedure to quantify using the Bioanalyzer).\nIt is recommended to quantify with multiple methods and review results with PI to plan for pooling plates.\n11. Normalize plate pools to between 2.5nM -5nM (the final concentration may vary based on plate quantification outcome and PI recommendations)\n¬†¬†¬†¬†a. Starting with 10ul of BSS DNA (bead size selected DNA)\nEXAMPLE: 10ul BSS DNA x 15.73nM (qPCR conc.) / 5nM (agreed upon conc) = 31.46ul -10ul BSS DNA = 21.46 ul TE/Tween So you would take 10ul of BSS DNA + 21.46ul TE/Tween to dilute it to 5nM\nNote: see Appendix C for converting from ng/ul to nM\n¬†¬†¬†¬†b. Combine 5ul of each normalized pooled plate to make your final library. Note: it is good practice to also quantify the pooled library before sending to the sequencing facility or loading onto the MiSeq. Refer to step 10 above for quantification methods.\n12. If running library on MiSeq in house, refer to NG-004.00 Procedure to run the MiSeq.\nWaste Management: Plastics and other liquids can be thrown in the trash.

The GTseq panel that I am using also includes microsatellite loci, step\n\nStep One- Creating Directories, running fastqc, Trimming filename.fastq.gz, running fastqc on trimmed, generating filename.sam, filename.bam files, extracting microsatellite reads for MEGASAT, compressing filename.sam file for Microhaplot\nDescription:\nThis step is currently done on Ahi our legacy HPC, in the near future these scripts will need to be adjusted.\nWorkflow:\n1. open create_directories.sh, edit the following variables in the script: run, sp(species), project, and user information\n2. run create_directories.sh\n3. transfer .fastq.gz to appropriate directory\n4. open map2ref.sh, edit the following variables in the script: run, sp(species), project, and user* information, additionally, edit the location for ref files\n5. verify that the ref files are in the correct location\n6. verify that fastq.gz files have the following format *labID_sample#_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\n7. run map2ref.sh inputs::\n- filename.fastq.gz\n- ref.fasta, file containing the sequence for each locus in panel\n- msat_primerF.txt, file containing msat forward primer\n- adaptorGT.fasta, contains illumina index adapters used in primer design\noutputs: - fastqc file for each raw fastq\n- fastqc file for each trimmed fastq\n- readcounts.txt containing raw read count for each fastq\n- trimmed_readcounts.txt containg read counts remaining after quality trimming\n- mapped_readcounts.txt containing # of reads that aligned to the ref.fasta\n- msat_readcounts.txt, contain the # of reads that contain any of the forward primer for microsatellite loci\n- a depth folder with a labID.coverage file for each fastq, has read counts for each locus in ref.fasta\n- tar.gz file with the labID*_mapped2ref.sam files for each fastq\nlink to github scripts: - https://github.com/amyfrey/GTseq/blob/main/create_directories.sh\n- https://github.com/amyfrey/GTseq/blob/main/map2ref.sh\n- https://github.com/amyfrey/GTseq/blob/main/ref/DcGTseqPanel_205_112122.fasta\n- https://github.com/amyfrey/GTseq/blob/main/ref/dc_msat_primerF.txt\n- https://github.com/amyfrey/GTseq/blob/main/ref/adaptorGT.fasta\n\nStep Two- Reviewing the coverage for the run\nDescription:\nThe purpose of this script is to get a general idea how the coverage looks across the entire run as well as for the individual loci and samples.\ninputs::\n- sampleinfo.txt, with the following column headers Lab_ID, Plate_ID, Well_ID, Sample_ID this file is something that you will have to make.\n- readcounts.txt containing raw read count for each fastq\n- trimmed_readcounts.txt containg read counts remaining after quality trimming\n- mapped_readcounts.txt containing # of reads that aligned to the ref.fasta\n- msat_readcounts.txt, contain the # of reads that contain any of the forward primer for microsatellite loci\n- a depth folder with a labID.coverage file for each fastq, has read counts for each locus in ref.fasta\n- list of loci as columns(all in one row, with first column called Lab_ID, and last column prop_loci_&gt;10), example of format shown in dc205_list of loci.txt - list of loci as rows (all in one row, with first row called Locus_ID), example of format shown in loci.txt outputs:\n- coveragesummary.pdf\nlink to github scripts:\n- https://github.com/amyfrey/GTseq/blob/main/run_coverage_review.r\nStep Three- Generating a .vcf file for Microhaplot Description:\nThe varient caller that is currently being used for this step is freebayes. After freebayes is run, it is important to clean up the .vcf file before moving on to the next step. That is currently done with vcftools, if I known list of varients exists it is easy use the ‚Äìexclude-positions option, after creating a list of varients that you want to remove from the .vcf file. inputs:\n- freebayes requires filename.bam files, and a list of filename.bam files. Our practice at this step is to use the pdf above to identify individuals to not include in the varient calling analysis\n- vcftools ‚Äìexclude-positions requires a vcf file, as well as a text file that lists the varients to remove.\noutputs:\n- filename.vcf\n- filename_targetloci_recode.vcf\ncommands used:\n- freebayes-parallel &lt;(fasta_generate_regions.py /home/afrey/gtseq/ref/DcGTseqPanel_205_112122.fasta.fai 200) 6 -f /home/afrey/gtseq/ref/DcGTseqPanel_205_112122.fasta -L ./bamlist_100423.txt ‚Äìhaplotype-length 0 -kwVa ‚Äìno-mnps ‚Äìno-complex ‚Äìmin-coverage 10 ‚Äìuse-best-n-alleles 4 ‚Äìmin-alternate-count 5 ‚Äìmin-alternate-fraction 0.3 &gt; Dcor_mex_fem_DcPanel_205_100423.vcf\n- vcftools ‚Äìvcf ./Dcor_gtseq_fem_DcPanel205_053123.vcf ‚Äìout ./Dcor_gtseq_fem_DcPanel205.targetSNPs ‚Äìexclude-positions ./non.target.locs.to.remove2.txt ‚Äìrecode ‚Äìrecode-INFO-all\n\nStep Four- Running Microhaplot\nDescription:\n\ninputs:\n- filename.sam files - filename_targetloci_recode.vcf\noutputs:\n\nlink to manual:\n- https://ngthomas.github.io/microhaplot/\nStep Five- Microsatellite Analysis using MEGASAT\nDescription:\nThis step is only necessary if there are microsatellite loci in your panel. If so the software we are using is a perl script called MEGASAT. inputs:\n- labID_msat.fastq (generated in step one above) - MEGASAT_Genotype.pl - primer-input.txt, see documentation for formate\noutputs:\n- genotype.txt\n- number_Discarded.txt\n- Number_Sorted.txt\n- Number_Trimmed.txt\n- Ratios_Threshold_.txt\n- directory: Discarded\n- directory: length_distribution\n- directory: Sorted\n- directory: Trimmed\nlink to github:\n- https://github.com/beiko-lab/MEGASAT\nStep Six- Importing Genotypes into SWFSC Genotypes Database Description:\nThis step is still in process.
